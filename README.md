Data and code for Pollinator community species richness dilutes prevalence of multiple viruses within multiple host species manuscript, published in Ecology in 2021.

### Abstract
Most pathogens are embedded in complex communities composed of multiple interacting hosts, but we’re still learning how community-level factors, such as host diversity, abundance, and composition, may influence pathogen spread. Pollinator communities are a good system to test how community-level factors influence pathogens because several RNA viruses, including deformed wing virus (DWV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and sacbrood virus (SBV), are transmitted between managed European honey bees (reservoir host) and native pollinators. We conducted a field survey of pollinator communities to investigate 1) how pathogen prevalence differs among host species and pathogens, 2) how pathogen prevalence varies among communities that differ in species richness, relative abundance, and composition, and 3) whether relationships between pathogen prevalence and community-level factors are similar or different among host–pathogen pairs. We tested Apis mellifera (honey bees), Bombus impatiens, Lasioglossum spp., and Eucera pruinosa for DWV, BQCV, and SBV presence and infection prevalence in 14 pollinator communities. A. mellifera and B. impatiens had significantly higher viral prevalence than Lasioglossum spp. and E. pruinosa. Pollinator community species richness had the strongest and most consistent impact on virus prevalence in eight of the twelve host–virus pairs (4 hosts x 3 viruses). Pollinators in species-rich communities had lower viral prevalence than pollinators from species-poor communities, demonstrating the dilution effect for the first time in a pollinator pathogen system. None of the host–virus pairs showed an increase in virus prevalence with species richness (i.e. amplification effect). Other community-level factors, such as total pollinator abundance, species-specific pollinator abundance, and community composition were rarely linked with virus prevalence and did not show any consistent patterns among host–virus pairs. Furthermore, biodiversity–disease relationships were more similar among hosts infected with the same pathogen, rather than among pathogens infecting the same host species. Our results suggest that subtle ecological differences in either hosts or pathogens can result in quite different outcomes for how community factors influence pathogen prevalence. Therefore, investigating ‘replicate’ communities infected by similar pathogens may be key to elucidating why patterns of dilution vary among different host–pathogen pairs.
